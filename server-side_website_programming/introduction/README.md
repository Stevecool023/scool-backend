# Introduction to server side.
Understanding additional power available to websites through server-side coding.<br />
Server-side programming is also known as back-end scripting.<br />
<br />

***Two types of websites:***

### Static websites.
Served content is hand-coded and never changes.<br />
**Basic web server architecture for a static site:**
<img src="static-site.png" title="static site" alt="static site">

### Dynamic websites.
Content is produced dynamically, like in HTML content is served through placeholders.<br />
**Basic web server architecture for a dynamic site:**
<img src="dynamic-site.png" title="dynamic site" alt="dynamic site">


## Server-side versus client-side programming.
Client-side code is primarily concerned with improving the appearance and behavior of a rendered web page.
This includes:
* selecting and styling UI components
* creating layouts
* navigation
* form validation
* etc.

On the other hand, server-side website programming mostly involves choosing which content is returned to the browser in response to requests.
Server-side code handles tasks like:
* validating submitted data and requests
* using databases to store and retrieve data and sending correct data to the client as required.
